## Project
A new commercial tool that collects customer feedback from various sources including website, mobile app and social media has been released. The Head of Customer Experience has approached you, seeking to gain deeper insights into the customer feedback. 
They want to know more about customer satisfaction levels and have tasked you with conducting an analysis to identify key topics discussed in the customer feedback data (reviews.json), 
as well as classifying the sentiment of the reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. 

## Tasks
Task:
Conduct a topic clustering analysis on the customer feedback data to determine the main themes and topics discussed in the reviews.
Develop a supervised sentiment model and evaluate its efficiency on the provided data.
